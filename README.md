## OpenCV and MoviePy Video Processor
This project is a video processor that uses the OpenCV and MoviePy libraries to edit and enhance videos. The goal is to create a cinematic effect by adding cuts, audio, and color grading to nature videos.

## Requirements
To use this project, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV
3. MoviePy

## You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

```pip install opencv-python moviepy```

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/opencv-moviepy-video-processor.git```
Navigate to the project directory:

```cd video-processor```


Run the video_processor.py script to process the video:

```python3 video_processor.py```
[To Update] : Replace [INPUT_VIDEO_PATH] with the path to the input video file, and [OUTPUT_VIDEO_PATH] with the desired path for the output video file.

## Examples
Here are some examples of the kind of edits and enhancements that can be achieved with this project:
